Parliament passed the Stamp Act in 1765 to pay for British military troops stationed in the American colonies after the French and Indian War. Parliament had previously passed legislation to regulate trade, but the Stamp Act introduced a new principle of a direct internal tax. Americans began to question the extent of the British Parliament's power in America, and the colonial legislatures argued that they had exclusive right to impose taxes within their jurisdictions.[47] Colonists condemned the tax because their rights as Englishmen protected them from being taxed by a Parliament in which they had no elected representatives.[48] Parliament argued that the colonies were "represented virtually", an idea that was criticized throughout the Empire.[49] Parliament did repeal the act in 1766, but it also affirmed its right to pass laws that were binding on the colonies.[50] From 1767, Parliament began passing legislation to raise revenue for the salaries of civil officials, ensuring their loyalty while inadvertently increasing resentment among the colonists, and opposition soon became widespread.[51][52]

Two ships in a harbor, one in the distance. On board, men stripped to the waist and wearing feathers in their hair throw crates of tea overboard. A large crowd, mostly men, stands on the dock, waving hats and cheering. A few people wave their hats from windows in a nearby building.
This iconic 1846 lithograph by Nathaniel Currier was entitled "The Destruction of Tea at Boston Harbor"; the phrase "Boston Tea Party" had not yet become standard. Contrary to Currier's depiction, few of the men dumping the tea were actually disguised as Indians.[53]
Enforcing the acts proved difficult. The seizure of the sloop Liberty in 1768 on suspicions of smuggling triggered a riot. In response, British troops occupied Boston, and Parliament threatened to extradite colonists to face trial in England.[54] Tensions rose after the murder of Christopher Seider by a customs official in 1770 and escalated into outrage after British troops fired on civilians in the Boston Massacre.[55] In 1772, colonists in Rhode Island boarded and burned a customs schooner. Parliament then repealed all taxes except the one on tea, passing the Tea Act in 1773, attempting to force colonists to buy East India Company tea on which the Townshend duties were paid, thus implicitly agreeing to Parliamentary supremacy. The landing of the tea was resisted in all colonies, but the governor of Massachusetts permitted British tea ships to remain in Boston Harbor, so the Sons of Liberty destroyed the tea chests in what became known as the "Boston Tea Party".[56]

Parliament then passed punitive legislation. It closed Boston Harbor until the tea was paid for and revoked the Massachusetts Charter, taking upon themselves the right to directly appoint the Massachusetts Governor's Council. Additionally, the royal governor was granted powers to undermine local democracy.[57][58] Further measures allowed the extradition of officials for trial elsewhere in the Empire, if the governor felt that a fair trial could not be secured locally. The act's vague reimbursement policy for travel expenses left few with the ability to testify, and colonists argued that it would allow officials to harass them with impunity.[59] Further laws allowed the governor to billet troops in private property without permission.[60] The colonists referred to the measures as the "Intolerable Acts", and they argued that their constitutional rights and their natural rights were being violated, viewing the acts as a threat to all of America.[61] The acts were widely opposed, driving neutral parties into support of the Patriots and curtailing Loyalist sentiment.[62][63]

Colonial response
The colonists responded by establishing the Massachusetts Provincial Congress, effectively removing Crown control of the colony outside Boston. Meanwhile, representatives from twelve colonies[64][65] convened the First Continental Congress to respond to the crisis. The Congress narrowly rejected a proposal to create an American parliament to act in concert with the British Parliament; instead, they passed a compact declaring a trade boycott against Britain.[66][67] The Congress also affirmed that Parliament had no authority over internal American matters, but they were willing to consent to trade regulations for the benefit of the empire,[68] and they authorized committees and conventions to enforce the boycott. The boycott was effective, as imports from Britain dropped by 97% in 1775 compared to 1774.[67]

Parliament refused to yield. In 1775, it declared Massachusetts to be in a state of rebellion and enforced a blockade of the colony.[69][70] It then passed legislation to limit colonial trade to the British West Indies and the British Isles. Colonial ships were barred from the Newfoundland cod fisheries, a measure which pleased Canadiens but damaged New England's economy. These increasing tensions led to a mutual scramble for ordnance and pushed the colonies toward open war.[71] Thomas Gage was the British Commander-in-Chief and military governor of Massachusetts, and he received orders on April 14, 1775, to disarm the local militias.[72]

Major campaigns of the American Revolutionary War
On April 18, 1775, 700 British troops were sent to confiscate militia ordnance stored at Concord.[73][74] Fighting broke out, forcing the troops to conduct a fighting withdrawal to Boston. Overnight, the local militia converged on and laid siege to Boston.[75] On May 25, 4,500 British reinforcements arrived with generals William Howe, John Burgoyne, and Henry Clinton.[76] The British seized the Charlestown peninsula on June 17 after a costly frontal assault,[77][78] leading Howe to replace Gage.[79] Many senior officers were dismayed at the attack, which had gained them little,[80] while Gage wrote to London stressing the need for a large army to suppress the revolt.[81] On July 3, George Washington took command of the Continental Army besieging Boston. Howe made no effort to attack, much to Washington's surprise.[82] A plan was rejected to assault the city,[83] and the Americans instead fortified Dorchester Heights in early March 1776 with heavy artillery captured from a raid on Fort Ticonderoga.[84] The British were permitted to withdraw unmolested on March 17, and they sailed to Halifax, Nova Scotia. Washington then moved his army to New York.[85]

Starting in August 1775, American Privateers began to raid villages in Nova Scotia, first at Saint John, then Charlottetown and Yarmouth. They continued in 1776 at Canso and then a land assault on Fort Cumberland.


The British marching to Concord
Meanwhile, British officials in Quebec began lobbying Indian tribes to support them,[86] while the Americans urged them to maintain their neutrality.[87][88] In April 1775, Congress feared an Anglo-Indian attack from Canada and authorized an invasion of Quebec. Quebec had a largely Francophone population and had been under British rule for only 12 years,[89] and the Americans expected that they would welcome being liberated from the British.[90][91][92] The Americans attacked Quebec City on December 31 after an arduous march[93] but were defeated.[94][95] After a loose siege, the Americans withdrew on May 6. 1776.[96][97] A failed counter-attack on June 8 ended American operations in Quebec.[98] However, the British could not conduct an aggressive pursuit because of American ships on Lake Champlain. On October 11, the British defeated the American squadron, forcing them to withdraw to Ticonderoga and ending the campaign. The invasion cost the Patriots their support in British public opinion,[99] while aggressive anti-Loyalist policies diluted Canadian support.[100] The Patriots continued to view Quebec as a strategic aim, though no further attempts to invade were ever made.[101]

In Virginia, Royal governor Lord Dunmore had attempted to disarm the militia as tensions increased, although no fighting broke out.[102] He issued a proclamation on November 7, 1775, promising freedom for slaves who fled their Patriot masters to fight for the Crown.[103][104] Dunmore's troops were overwhelmed by Patriots at Great Bridge, and Dunmore fled to naval ships anchored off Norfolk. Subsequent negotiations broke down, so Dunmore ordered the ships to destroy the town.[105]

Fighting broke out on November 19 in South Carolina between Loyalist and Patriot militias,[106] and the Loyalists were subsequently driven out of the colony.[107] Loyalists were recruited in North Carolina to reassert colonial rule in the South, but they were decisively defeated and Loyalist sentiment was subdued.[108] A troop of British regulars set out to reconquer South Carolina and launched an attack on Charleston on June 28, 1776,[109] but it failed and effectively left the South in Patriot control until 1780.[110][111]

The shortage of gunpowder had led Congress to authorize an expedition against the Bahamas colony in the British West Indies in order to secure ordnance there.[112] On March 3, 1776, the Americans landed after a bloodless exchange of fire, and the local militia offered no resistance.[113] They confiscated all the supplies that they could load and sailed away on March 17.[114][115] The squadron reached New London, Connecticut, on April 8, after a brief skirmish with the Royal Navy frigate HMS Glasgow on April 6.[116]

Political reactions
Main articles: Olive Branch Petition and United States Declaration of Independence
After fighting began, Congress launched a final attempt to avert war, which Parliament rejected as insincere.[117] King George then issued a Proclamation of Rebellion on August 23, 1775, which only served to embolden the colonists in their determination to become independent.[118] After a speech by the King, Parliament rejected coercive measures on the colonies by 170 votes.[119] British Tories refused to compromise,[120] while Whigs argued that current policy would drive the colonists towards independence.[121] Despite opposition, the King himself began micromanaging the war effort.[122] The Irish Parliament pledged to send troops to America,[123] and Irish Catholics were allowed to enlist in the army for the first time.[124] Irish Protestants favored the Americans, while Catholics favored the King.[125]

The initial hostilities provided a sobering military lesson for the British, causing them to rethink their views on colonial military capability.[126][127] The weak British response gave the Patriots the advantage, and the British lost control over every colony.[128] The army had been deliberately kept small in England since 1688 to prevent abuses of power by the King.[129] Parliament secured treaties with small German states for additional troops[130] and sent an army of 32,000 men to America after a year, the largest that it had ever sent outside Europe at the time.[131]

In the colonies, the success of Thomas Paine's pamphlet Common Sense had boosted public support for independence.[132][133] On July 2, Congress voted in favor of independence with twelve affirmatives and one abstention,[134] issuing its declaration on July 4.[135] Washington read the declaration to his men and the citizens of New York on July 9,[136] invigorating the crowd to tear down a lead statue of the King and melting it to make bullets.[137] British Tories criticized the signatories for not extending the same standards of equality to slaves.

Patriots followed independence with the Test Laws, requiring residents to swear allegiance to the state in which they lived,[138] intending to root out neutrals or opponents to independence. Failure to do so meant possible imprisonment, exile, or even death.[139] American Tories were barred from public office, forbidden from practising medicine and law, forced to pay increased taxes, or even barred from executing wills or becoming guardians to orphans.[140][141] Congress enabled states to confiscate Loyalist property to fund the war.[142] Some Quakers who remained neutral had their property confiscated. States later prevented Loyalists from collecting any debts that they were owed.[143]

British counter-offensive (1776–1777)
Main article: New York and New Jersey campaign

American soldiers in combat at the Battle of Long Island, 1776
After regrouping at Halifax, William Howe determined to take the fight to the Americans.[144] He set sail in June 1776 and began landing troops on Staten Island near the entrance to New York Harbor on July 2. Based on poor military intelligence, Washington split his army to positions on Manhattan Island and across the East River in western Long Island,[145] and an informal attempt to negotiate peace was rejected by the Americans.[146] On August 27, Howe outflanked Washington and forced him back to Brooklyn Heights. Howe restrained his subordinates from pursuit, opting to besiege Washington instead.[147]

Washington withdrew to Manhattan without any losses in men or ordnance.[148] Following the withdrawal, the Staten Island Peace Conference failed to negotiate peace, as the British delegates did not possess the authority to recognize independence.[149][150] Howe then seized control of New York City on September 15, and unsuccessfully engaged the Americans the following day.[151] He attempted to encircle Washington, but the Americans successfully withdrew. On October 28, the British fought an indecisive action against Washington, in which Howe declined to attack Washington's army, instead concentrating his efforts upon a hill that was of no strategic value.[152][153]


British warships forcing passage of the Hudson River
Washington's retreat left his forces isolated, and the British captured an American fortification on November 16, taking 3,000 prisoners and amounting to what one historian terms "the most disastrous defeat of the entire war".[154] Washington's army fell back four days later.[155] Henry Clinton then captured Newport, Rhode Island, an operation which he opposed, feeling that the 6,000 troops assigned to him could have been better employed in the pursuit of Washington.[156][157][158] The American prisoners were then sent to the infamous prison ships in which more American soldiers and sailors died of disease and neglect than died in every battle of the war combined.[159] Charles Cornwallis pursued Washington, but Howe ordered him to halt, and Washington marched away unmolested.[160][161]

The outlook of the American cause was bleak; the army had dwindled to fewer than 5,000 men and would be reduced further when the enlistments expired at the end of the year.[162] Popular support wavered, morale ebbed away, and Congress abandoned Philadelphia.[163] Loyalist activity surged in the wake of the American defeat, especially in New York.[141]


Emanuel Leutze's famous 1851 depiction of Washington Crossing the Delaware
News of the campaign was well received in Britain. Festivities took place in London, public support reached a peak,[164][165] and the King awarded the Order of the Bath to William Howe. The successes led to predictions that the British could win within a year.[166] The American defeat revealed what one writer views as Washington's strategic deficiencies, such as dividing a numerically weaker army in the face of a stronger one, his inexperienced staff misreading the situation, and his troops fleeing in disorder when fighting began.[167] In the meantime, the British entered winter quarters and were in a good place to resume campaigning.[168]

On December 25, 1776, Washington stealthily crossed the Delaware River, and his army overwhelmed the Hessian (soldier) garrison at Trenton, New Jersey, the following morning, taking 900 prisoners.[169][170] The decisive victory rescued the army's flagging morale and gave a new hope to the cause for independence.[171] Cornwallis marched to retake Trenton, but his efforts were repulsed on January 2.[172][173] Washington outmanoeuvred Cornwallis that night, and defeated his rearguard the following day. The victories proved instrumental in convincing the French and Spanish that the Americans were worthwhile allies, as well as recovering morale in the army.[174][175][176] Washington entered winter quarters at Morristown, New Jersey, on January 6,[177] though a protracted guerrilla conflict continued.[178] While encamped, Howe made no attempt to attack, much to Washington's amazement.[179]

British northern strategy fails (1777–1778)
Main articles: Saratoga campaign and Philadelphia campaign
In December 1776, John Burgoyne returned to London to set strategy with Lord George Germain. Burgoyne's plan was to establish control of the Champlain-George-Hudson route from New York to Quebec, isolating New England. Efforts could then be concentrated on the southern colonies, where it was believed Loyalist support was in abundance.[180]


"The Surrender at Saratoga" shows General Daniel Morgan in front of a French de Vallière 4-pounder.
Burgoyne's plan was to lead an army along Lake Champlain, while a strategic diversion advanced along the Mohawk River, and both would rendezvous at Albany.[181] Burgoyne set out on June 14, 1777, quickly capturing Ticonderoga on July 5. Leaving 1,300 men behind as a garrison, Burgoyne continued the advance. Progress was slow; the Americans blocked roads, destroyed bridges, dammed streams and denuded the area of food.[182] Meanwhile, Barry St. Ledger's diversionary column laid siege to Fort Stanwix. St. Ledger withdrew to Quebec on August 22 after his Indian support abandoned him. On August 16, a Brunswick foraging expedition was soundly defeated at Bennington, and more than 700 troops were captured.[183] Meanwhile, the vast majority of Burgoyne's Indian support abandoned him and Howe informed Burgoyne he would launch his campaign on Philadelphia as planned, and would be unable to render aid.[184]

Burgoyne decided to continue the advance. On September 19, he attempted to flank the American position, and clashed at Freeman's Farm. The British won, but at the cost of 600 casualties. Burgoyne then dug in, but suffered a constant haemorrhage of deserters, and critical supplies were running low.[185] On October 7, a British reconnaissance in force against the American lines was repulsed with heavy losses. Burgoyne then withdrew with the Americans in pursuit, and by October 13, he was surrounded. With no hope of relief and supplies exhausted, Burgoyne surrendered on October 17, and 6,222 soldiers became prisoners of the Americans.[186] The decisive success spurred France to enter the war as an ally of the United States, securing the final elements needed for victory over Britain, that of foreign assistance.[187][188]


Washington and Lafayette inspect the troops at Valley Forge.
Meanwhile, Howe launched his campaign against Washington, though his initial efforts to bring him to battle in June 1777 failed.[189] Howe declined to attack Philadelphia overland via New Jersey, or by sea via the Delaware Bay, even though both options would have enabled him to assist Burgoyne if necessary. Instead, he took his army on a time-consuming route through the Chesapeake Bay, leaving him completely unable to assist Burgoyne. This decision was so difficult to understand, Howe's critics accused him of treason.[190]

Howe outflanked and defeated Washington on September 11, though he failed to follow-up on the victory and destroy his army.[191][192] A British victory at Willistown left Philadelphia defenceless, and Howe captured the city unopposed on September 26. Howe then moved 9,000 men to Germantown, north of Philadelphia.[193] Washington launched a surprise attack on Howe's garrison on October 4, which was eventually repulsed.[194] Again, Howe did not follow-up on his victory, leaving the American army intact and able to fight.[195] Later, after several days of probing American defences at White Marsh, Howe inexplicably ordered a retreat to Philadelphia, astonishing both sides.[196] Howe ignored the vulnerable American rear, where an attack could have deprived Washington of his baggage and supplies.[197] On December 19, Washington's army entered winter quarters at Valley Forge. Poor conditions and supply problems resulted in the deaths of some 2,500 troops.[198] Howe, only 20 miles (32 km) away, made no effort to attack, which critics observed could have ended the war.[199][200][201]

The Continental Army was put through a new training program, supervised by Baron von Steuben, introducing the most modern Prussian methods of drilling.[202] Meanwhile, Howe resigned and was replaced by Henry Clinton on May 24, 1778.[203] Clinton received orders to abandon Philadelphia and fortify New York following France's entry into the war. On June 18, the British departed Philadelphia, with the reinvigorated Americans in pursuit.[204] The two armies fought at Monmouth Court House on June 28, with the Americans holding the field, greatly boosting morale and confidence.[205] By July, both armies were back in the same positions they had been two years prior.

Foreign intervention
Main articles: France in the American Revolutionary War, Spain in the American Revolutionary War, and Carlisle Peace Commission
The defeat at Saratoga caused considerable anxiety in Britain over foreign intervention. The North ministry sought reconciliation with the colonies by consenting to their original demands,[206] although Lord North refused to grant independence.[207] No positive reply was received from the Americans.[208]


French troops storming Redoubt 9 during the Siege of Yorktown
French foreign minister the Comte de Vergennes was strongly anti-British,[209] and he sought a pretext for going to war with Britain following the conquest of Canada in 1763.[210] The French had covertly supplied the Americans through neutral Dutch ports since the onset of the war,[209] proving invaluable throughout the Saratoga campaign.[211][212][213] The French public favored war, though Vergennes and King Louis XVI were hesitant, owing to the military and financial risk.[214] The American victory at Saratoga convinced the French that supporting the Patriots was worthwhile,[215] but doing so also brought major concerns. The King was concerned that Britain's concessions would be accepted, and that Britain would then reconcile with the Colonies to strike at French and Spanish possessions in the Caribbean.[216][217] To prevent this, France formally recognized the United States on February 6, 1778, and followed with a military alliance. France aimed to expel Britain from the Newfoundland fishery, end restrictions on Dunkirk sovereignty, regain free trade in India, recover Senegal and Dominica, and restore the Treaty of Utrecht provisions pertaining to Anglo-French trade.[218][219]

Spain was wary of provoking war with Britain before being ready and opted to covertly supply the Patriots via its colonies in New Spain.[220][221] Congress hoped to persuade Spain into an open alliance, so the first American Commission met with the Count of Aranda in 1776.[222] Spain was still reluctant to make an early commitment, owing to a lack of direct French involvement, the threat against their treasure fleets, and the possibility of war with Portugal, Spain's neighbor and a close ally of Britain.[223] However, Spain affirmed its desire to support the Americans the following year, hoping to weaken Britain's empire.[224] The Portuguese threat was neutralized in the Spanish–Portuguese War (1776–77). On 12 April 1779, Spain signed the Treaty of Aranjuez with France and went to war against Britain.[225] Spain sought to recover Gibraltar and Menorca in Europe, as well as Mobile and Pensacola in Florida, and also to expel the British from Central America.[226][227]

Meanwhile, George III had given up on subduing America while Britain had a European war to fight.[228] He did not welcome war with France, but he believed that Britain had made all necessary steps to avoid it and cited the British victories over France in the Seven Years' War as a reason to remain optimistic.[229] Britain tried in vain to find a powerful ally to engage France, leaving it isolated,[230] preventing Britain from focusing the majority of her efforts in one theater,[231][232] and forcing a major diversion of military resources from America.[233][234] Despite this, the King determined never to recognize American independence and to ravage the colonies indefinitely, or until they pleaded to return to the yoke of the Crown.[235] Mahan argues that Britain's attempt to fight in multiple theaters simultaneously without major allies was fundamentally flawed, citing impossible mutual support, exposing the forces to defeat in detail.[236]

Since the outbreak of the conflict, Britain had appealed to her ally, the neutral Dutch Republic, to lend her the use of the Scots Brigade for service in America, but pro-American sentiment among the Dutch public forced them to deny the request.[237] Consequently, the British attempted to invoke several treaties for outright Dutch military support, but the Republic still refused. Moreover, American troops were being supplied with ordnance by Dutch merchants via their West Indies colonies.[238] French supplies bound for America had also passed through Dutch ports.[209] The Republic maintained free trade with France following France's declaration of war on Britain, citing a prior concession by Britain on this issue. Britain responded by confiscating Dutch shipping, and even firing upon it. Consequently, the Republic joined the First League of Armed Neutrality to enforce their neutral status.[239] The Republic had also given sanctuary to American privateers[240] and had drafted a treaty of commerce with the Americans. Britain argued that these actions contravened the Republic's neutral stance and declared war in December 1780.[241]

The Moonlight Battle of Cape St. Vincent, 16 January 1780 by Francis Holman, painted 1780
Soon after France declared war, French and British fleets fought an indecisive action off Ushant on July 27, 1778.[242] Spain entered the war on April 12, 1779, with a primary goal of capturing Gibraltar,[243] and Spanish troops under the Duc de Crillon laid siege to the Rock on June 24.[244] The naval blockade, however, was relatively weak, and the British were able to resupply the garrison.[245] Meanwhile, a plan was formulated for a combined Franco-Spanish invasion of the British mainland, but the expedition failed because of poor planning, disease, logistical issues, and high financial expenditures.[246][247] However, a diversionary Franco-American squadron did meet with some success on September 23 under John Paul Jones.[248] On 16 January 1780, the Royal Navy under George Rodney scored a major victory over the Spanish, weakening the naval blockade of Gibraltar.[249]

A Franco-Spanish fleet commanded by Luis de Córdova intercepted and decisively defeated a large British convoy off the Azores led by John Moutray on August 9 which was bound for the West Indies.[250] The defeat was catastrophic for Britain, which lost 52 merchant ships[251][252] and five East Indiamen,[253][254] as well as supplies and crews,[255] making it one of the most complete naval captures ever made.[256] The loss was valued at some £1.5 million (£181 million in today's money), dealing a severe blow to British commerce.[257][258]

Americas
The French blockaded the lucrative sugar islands of Barbados and Jamaica, intending to damage British trade.[259] French troops led by the Marquis de Bouillé captured Dominica on September 7, 1778, in order to improve communication among French Caribbean islands and to strike a blow against privateering.[260][261] The British defeated a French naval force on December 15 and captured St. Lucia on December 28.[262] Both fleets received reinforcements through the first half of 1779, but the French under the Comte d'Estaing had superiority in the Caribbean and began capturing British territories,[263] seizing St. Vincent on June 18 and Grenada on July 4.[264] The British fleet under John Byron was tactically defeated on July 6, having pursued d'Estaing from Grenada,[265] the worst loss that the Royal Navy had suffered since 1690.[266] Naval skirmishes continued until April 17, 1780, when British and French fleets clashed indecisively off Martinique.

General Bernardo de Gálvez raised an army in New Orleans and drove the British out of the Gulf of Mexico. He captured five British forts in the Lower Mississippi Valley, and they repelled a British and Indian attack in St. Louis, Missouri, and captured the British fort of St. Joseph in Niles, Michigan. He received reinforcements from Cuba, Mexico, and Puerto Rico, then captured Mobile and Pensacola, the capital of the British colony of West Florida.[267] At Pensacola, Gálvez commanded a multinational army of more than 7,000 black and white soldiers born in Spain, Cuba, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Santo Domingo, and other Spanish colonies such as Venezuela.[268]

In Central America, the defense of Guatemala was a priority for Spain. The British intended to capture the key fortress of San Fernando de Omoa and drive the Spanish from the region.[269] After inadequate first attempts, 1,200 British troops led by William Dalrymple arrived on October 16, and they captured the fort on October 20.[270] However, the British suffered terribly from disease and were forced to abandon the fort on November 29,[271] and Spanish troops subsequently reoccupied it.[272] In 1780, Jamaica's governor John Dalling planned an expedition to cut New Spain in two by capturing Granada, which would allow them full control of the San Juan River.[273] A British expedition set out on February 3, 1780, led by John Polson and Horatio Nelson.[274] They reached Fort San Juan on March 17 and laid siege, capturing it on April 29.[275] The British were ravaged by disease[276] and were running low on food because of poor logistics.[274] They withdrew on November 8, the expedition having suffered a decisive defeat;[277] some 2,500 troops had perished, making it the costliest British disaster of the war.[278]

India

The British East India Company moved quickly to capture French possessions in India when they learned about the hostilities with France, and they took Pondicherry on 19 October 1778 after a two-week siege.[279] The Company resolved to drive the French completely out of India,[280] and they captured the Malabar port of Mahé in 1779[281] through which French ordnance passed.

Mahé was under the protection of Mysore's ruler Hyder Ali (the Tipu Sultan), and tensions were already inflamed because the British had supported Malabar rebels who had risen against him;[282] so the fall of Mahé precipitated war.[283] Hyder Ali invaded the Carnatic region in July 1780 and laid siege to Tellicherry and Arcot. A British relief force of 7,000 men[284] under William Baille was intercepted and destroyed by the Tipu Sultan on 10 September, the worst defeat suffered by a European army in India at the time.[285]

Ali then renewed the siege at Arcot instead of pressing on for a decisive victory against a second British army at Madras, capturing it on 3 November. The delay allowed British forces to regroup for campaigning the following year.[286]

"Give 'em Watts, boys!" – American troops repulse Wilhelm von Knyphausen's attack at Springfield
Henry Clinton withdrew from Philadelphia, consolidating his forces in New York following the British defeat at Saratoga and the entry of France into the war.[234] French admiral the Comte d'Estaing had been dispatched to America in April 1778 to assist Washington, and he arrived shortly after Clinton withdrew into New York.[287] The Franco-American forces felt that New York's defenses were too formidable for the French fleet,[288] and they opted to attack Newport.[289] This effort was launched on August 29, but it failed when the French opted to withdraw, and this displeased the Americans.[290] The war then ground down to a stalemate, with the majority of actions fought as large skirmishes, such as those at Chestnut Neck and Little Egg Harbor. In the summer of 1779, the Americans captured British posts at Stony Point and Paulus Hook.[291][292]

In July, Clinton unsuccessfully attempted to coax Washington into a decisive engagement by making a major raid into Connecticut.[293] That month, a large American naval operation attempted to retake Maine, but it resulted in the worst American naval defeat until Pearl Harbor in 1941.[294] The high frequency of Iroquois raids compelled Washington to mount a punitive expedition which destroyed a large number of Iroquois settlements, but the effort ultimately failed to stop the raids.[295][296] During the winter of 1779–80, the Continental Army suffered greater hardships than at Valley Forge.[297] Morale was poor, public support was being eroded by the long war, the national currency was virtually worthless, the army was plagued with supply problems, desertion was common, and whole regiments mutinied over the conditions in early 1780.[298]


Hamilton surrenders at Vincennes, February 29, 1779
In 1780, Clinton launched an attempt to retake New Jersey. On June 7, 6,000 men invaded under Hessian general Wilhelm von Knyphausen, but they met stiff resistance from the local militia. The British held the field, but Knyphausen feared a general engagement with Washington's main army and withdrew.[299] Knyphausen and Clinton decided upon a second attempt two weeks later which was soundly defeated at Springfield, effectively ending British ambitions in New Jersey.[300] Meanwhile, American general Benedict Arnold turned traitor and joined the British army, and he conspired to betray the key American fortress of West Point by surrendering it to the enemy.[301] The plot was foiled when British spy master John André was captured, so Arnold fled to British lines in New York. He attempted to justify his betrayal by appealing to Loyalist public opinion, but the Patriots strongly condemned him as a coward and turncoat.[302]

The war to the west of the Appalachians was largely confined to skirmishing and raids. An expedition of militia was halted by adverse weather in February 1778 after it set out to destroy British military supplies in settlements along the Cuyahoga River.[303] Later in the year, a second campaign was undertaken to seize the Illinois Country from the British. The Americans captured Kaskaskia on July 4 and then secured Vincennes, although Vincennes was recaptured by Henry Hamilton, the British commander at Detroit. In early 1779, the Americans counter-attacked by undertaking a risky winter march, and they secured the surrender of the British at Vincennes, taking Hamilton prisoner.[304][305]

On May 25, 1780, the British launched an expedition into Kentucky as part of a wider operation to clear resistance from Quebec to the Gulf coast. The expedition met with only limited success, though hundreds of settlers were killed or captured.[306] The Americans responded with a major offensive along the Mad River in August which met with some success, but it did little to abate the Indian raids on the frontier.[307] French militia attempted to capture Detroit, but it ended in disaster when Miami Indians ambushed and defeated the gathered troops on November 5.[308] The war in the west had become a stalemate; the Americans did not have the manpower to simultaneously defeat the hostile Indian tribes and occupy the land.[309]

War in the South (1778–1781)

The British turned their attention to conquering the South in 1778 after Loyalists in London assured them of a strong Loyalist base there. A southern campaign also had the advantage of keeping the Royal Navy closer to the Caribbean, where it would be needed to defend lucrative colonies against the Franco-Spanish fleets.[310] On December 29, 1778, an expeditionary corps from New York captured Savannah, and British troops then moved inland to recruit Loyalist support.[311] There was a promising initial turnout in early 1779, but then a large Loyalist militia was defeated at Kettle Creek on February 14 and they had to recognize their dependence upon the British. The British, however, defeated Patriot militia at Brier Creek on March 3,[312] and then launched an abortive assault on Charleston, South Carolina. The operation became notorious for its high degree of looting by British troops, enraging both Loyalists and Patriots.[313]

In October, a combined Franco-American effort failed to recapture Savannah. In May 1780, Henry Clinton captured Charleston, taking over 5,000 prisoners and effectively destroying the Continental Army in the south. Organized American resistance in the region collapsed when Banastre Tarleton defeated the withdrawing Americans at Waxhaws on May 29.[314]

Clinton returned to New York, leaving Charles Cornwallis in command in Charleston to oversee the southern war effort. Far fewer Loyalists joined him than expected. In the interim, the war was carried on by Patriot militias who effectively suppressed Loyalists by winning victories in Fairfield County, Lincolnton, Huck's Defeat, Stanly County, and Lancaster County.

The British launched a surprise offensive in Virginia in January 1781, with Benedict Arnold invading Richmond, Virginia, to little resistance. Governor Thomas Jefferson escaped Richmond just ahead of the British forces, and the British burned the city to the ground.[315][316] Jefferson sent an emergency dispatch to Colonel Sampson Mathews whose militia was traveling nearby, to thwart Arnold's efforts.[317][318]

Congress appointed Horatio Gates, victor at Saratoga, to lead the American effort in the south. He suffered a major defeat at Camden on August 16, 1780, setting the stage for Cornwallis to invade North Carolina.[319] The British attempted to subjugate the countryside, and Patriot militia continued to fight against them, so Cornwallis dispatched troops to raise Loyalist forces to cover his left flank as he moved north.[320] This wing of Cornwallis' army was virtually destroyed on October 7, irreversibly breaking Loyalist support in the Carolinas. Cornwallis subsequently aborted his advance and retreated back into South Carolina.[321] In the interim, Washington replaced Gates with his trusted subordinate Nathanael Greene.[322]

Greene was unable to confront the British directly, so he dispatched a force under Daniel Morgan to recruit additional troops. Morgan then defeated the cream of the British army under Tarleton on January 17, 1781, at Cowpens. Cornwallis was criticized for having detached a substantial part of his army without adequate support,[323] but he advanced into North Carolina despite the setbacks, gambling that he would receive substantial Loyalist support there. Greene evaded combat with Cornwallis, instead wearing the British down through a protracted war of attrition.[324]
